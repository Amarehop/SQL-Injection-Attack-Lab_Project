In this lab, we have seen SQL injection attacks and how they can happen in a vulnerable login web page and when updating a database by using crafted malicious input in the case of insecure code. SQL injection attacks can occur when user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in a SQL query.

To prevent SQL injection attacks, the recommended approach is to use prepared statements instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL queries. Prepared statements separate the SQL query from the user input, and the database engine will treat the user input as data rather than part of the SQL syntax.

By using prepared statements, the user input is properly escaped or parameterized, ensuring that any malicious SQL code included in the input will not be executed as part of the SQL query. This effectively prevents SQL injection attacks and helps to keep the application secure.

In summary, the key steps to prevent SQL injection attacks are:

Use prepared statements when constructing SQL queries that involve user input.
Properly sanitize and validate all user input before using it in SQL queries.
Implement strong input validation and output encoding to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
